    <h4 class="CAVERSHAM">LORD CAVERSHAM.</h4> Because he leads such an idle life.</p>

    <p class="speech">
    <h4 class="MABELCHILTERN">MABEL CHILTERN.</h4> How can you say such a thing? Why, he rides in the Row
    at ten o’clock in the morning, goes to the Opera three times a week,
    changes his clothes at least five times a day, and dines out every night
    of the season. You don’t call that leading an idle life, do you?</p>

    <p class="speech">
    <h4 class="LADYCHILTERN">LORD CAVERSHAM.</h4>
    <p class="stagedirection"> [_Looking at her with a kindly twinkle in his eyes_.]</p>You are a very charming young
    lady!</p>


    <p class="speech">
    <h4 class="MABELCHILTERN">MABEL CHILTERN.</h4> How sweet of you to say that, Lord Caversham! Do come
    to us more often. You know we are always at home on Wednesdays, and you
    look so well with your star!</p>

    <p class="speech">
    <h4 class="LADYCHILTERN">LORD CAVERSHAM.</h4> Never go anywhere now. Sick of London Society.
    Shouldn’t mind being introduced to my own tailor; he always votes on the
    right side. But object strongly to being sent down to dinner with my
    wife’s milliner. Never could stand Lady Caversham’s bonnets.</p>

    <p class="speech">
    <h4 class="MABELCHILTERN">MABEL CHILTERN.</h4> Oh, I love London Society! I think it has immensely
    improved. It is entirely composed now of beautiful idiots and brilliant
    lunatics. Just what Society should be.</p>
