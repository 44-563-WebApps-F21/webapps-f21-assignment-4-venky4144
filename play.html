        <h3> An ideal husband Play   </h3>
        <h5>The room is brilliantly lighted and full of guests.At the top of
            the staircase stands LADY CHILTERN, a woman of grave Greek beauty,
            about twenty-seven years of age.She receives the guests as they come
            up.Over the well of the staircase hangs a great chandelier with wax
            lights, which illumine a large eighteenth-century French
            tapestry—representing the Triumph of Love, from a design by
            Boucher—that is stretched on the staircase wall.  On the right is the
            entrance to the music-room.  The sound of a string quartette is faintly
            heard.The entrance on the left leads to other reception-rooms.  MRS.
            MARCHMONT and LADY BASILDON, two very pretty women, are seated
            together on a Louis Seize sofa.  They are types of exquisite
            fragility.Their affectation of manner has a delicate charm.
            Watteau would have loved to paint them.</h5>

MRS. MARCHMONT:  Going on to the Hartlocks’ to-night, Margaret?
<br>
LADY BASILDON:  I suppose so.  Are you?
<br>
MRS. MARCHMONT: Yes.  Horribly tedious parties they give, don’t they?
<br>
LADY BASILDON:  Horribly tedious!  Never know why I go.  Never know why I
go anywhere.
<br>
MRS. MARCHMONT:  I come here to be educated.
<br>
LADY BASILDON:  Ah! I hate being educated!
<br>
MRS. MARCHMONT:  So do I.  It puts one almost on a level with the
commercial classes, doesn’t it?  But dear Gertrude Chiltern is always
telling me that I should have some serious purpose in life.  So I come
here to try to find one.
<br>
LADY BASILDON:  [Looking round through her lorgnette.]  I don’t see
anybody here to-night whom one could possibly call a serious purpose.
The man who took me in to dinner talked to me about his wife the whole
time.
<br>
MRS. MARCHMONT:  How very trivial of him!
