        <h3> An ideal husband Play   </h3>
        <h5>The room is brilliantly lighted and full of guests.At the top of
            the staircase stands LADY CHILTERN, a woman of grave Greek beauty,
            about twenty-seven years of age.She receives the guests as they come
            up.Over the well of the staircase hangs a great chandelier with wax
            lights, which illumine a large eighteenth-century French
            tapestry—representing the Triumph of Love, from a design by
            Boucher—that is stretched on the staircase wall.  On the right is the
            entrance to the music-room.  The sound of a string quartette is faintly
            heard.The entrance on the left leads to other reception-rooms.  MRS.
            MARCHMONT and LADY BASILDON, two very pretty women, are seated
            together on a Louis Seize sofa.  They are types of exquisite
            fragility.Their affectation of manner has a delicate charm.
            Watteau would have loved to paint them.</h5>
