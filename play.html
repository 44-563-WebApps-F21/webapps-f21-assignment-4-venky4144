        <h3> An ideal husband Play   </h3>
        <h5>The room is brilliantly lighted and full of guests.At the top of
            the staircase stands LADY CHILTERN, a woman of grave Greek beauty,
            about twenty-seven years of age.She receives the guests as they come
            up.Over the well of the staircase hangs a great chandelier with wax
            lights, which illumine a large eighteenth-century French
            tapestry—representing the Triumph of Love, from a design by
            Boucher—that is stretched on the staircase wall.  On the right is the
            entrance to the music-room.  The sound of a string quartette is faintly
            heard.The entrance on the left leads to other reception-rooms.  MRS.
            MARCHMONT and LADY BASILDON, two very pretty women, are seated
            together on a Louis Seize sofa.  They are types of exquisite
            fragility.Their affectation of manner has a delicate charm.
            Watteau would have loved to paint them.</h5>

<h6>MRS. MARCHMONT</h6>:  Going on to the Hartlocks’ to-night, Margaret?</p>

<p class="speech">

<h6>LADY BASILDON</h6>:  I suppose so.  Are you?</p>


<p class="speech">
<h6> MARCHMONT</h6>6 Yes.  Horribly tedious parties they give, don’t they?</p>

<p class="speech">

<h6> BASILDON</h6>h6  Horribly tedious!  Never know why I go.  Never know why I
go anywhere.</p>

<p class="speech">

<h6> MARCHMONT</h6>:  I come here to be educated.</p>

<p class="speech">

<h6> BASILDON</h6>:  Ah! I hate being educated!</p>

<p class="speech">

<h6>MRS. MARCHMONT</h6>:  So do I.  It puts one almost on a level with the
commercial classes, doesn’t it?  But dear Gertrude Chiltern is always
telling me that I should have some serious purpose in life.  So I come
here to try to find one.</p>

<p class="speech">

<h6> BASILDON</h6>:  [Looking round through her lorgnette.]  I don’t see
anybody here to-night whom one could possibly call a serious purpose.
The man who took me in to dinner talked to me about his wife the whole
time.</p>

<p class="speech">

<h6> MARCHMONT</h6>:  How very trivial of him!</p>


<p class="speech">
    <h6> LADY BASILDON.</h6>
    <p>stagedirection :hover>[_Languidly_.] And were you interested?</p>

    <p class="speech">
    <h6>MRS. MARCHMONT.</h6>
    <p> stagedirection :hover> [_Shaking her head_.] Not in the smallest degree.</p>

    <p class="BASILDON">
    <h6>LADY BASILDON.</h6> What martyrs we are, dear Margaret!</p>

    <p class="speech">
    <h6>MRS. MARCHMONT.</h6>
    <p> stagedirection :hover> [_Rising_.] And how well it becomes us, Olivia!</p>

    <p>stagedirection :hover>[_They rise and go towards the music-room_. _The_ VICOMTE DE NANJAC, _a
        young attaché known for his neckties and his Anglomania_, _approaches
        with a low bow_, _and enters into conversation_.]</p>

    <p class="speech">
    <h6>MASON.</h4>
    <p>stagedirection :hover> [_Announcing guests from the top of the staircase_.] Mr. and
    Lady Jane Barford. Lord Caversham.</p>

    <p>stagedirection :hover>[_Enter_ LORD CAVERSHAM, _an old gentleman of seventy_, _wearing the
        riband and star of the Garter_. _A fine Whig type_. _Rather like a
        portrait by Lawrence_.]</p>

    <p class="speech">
    <h6>LORD CAVERSHAM.</h6> Good evening, Lady Chiltern! Has my good-for-nothing
    young son been here?</p>

    <p class="speech">
    <h6>LADY CHILTERN.</h6>
    <p>stagedirection :hover> [_Smiling_.]  I don’t think Lord Goring has arrived yet.</p>

    <p> class="speech">
    <h6>MABEL CHILTERN.</h6>
    <p>stagedirection :hover> [_Coming up to_ LORD CAVERSHAM.]</p> Why do you call Lord
    Goring good-for-nothing?</p>

    <p>stagedirection :hover>[MABEL CHILTERN _is a perfect example of the English type of prettiness_,
        _the apple-blossom type_. _She has all the fragrance and freedom of a
        flower_. _There is ripple after ripple of sunlight in her hair_, _and
        the little mouth_, _with its parted lips_, _is expectant_, _like the
        mouth of a child_. _She has the fascinating tyranny of youth_, _and the
        astonishing courage of innocence_. _To sane people she is not
        reminiscent of any work of art_. _But she is really like a Tanagra
        statuette_, _and would be rather annoyed if she were told so_.]</p>
